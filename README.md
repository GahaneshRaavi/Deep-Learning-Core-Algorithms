# Deep-Learning-Core-Algorithms
A foundations-focused deep learning project implementing gradient descent, logistic regression, and linear regression from scratch using NumPy. The workflow explores learning rate convergence, vectorization, forward and backward propagation, and single-neuron models applied to breast cancer and diabetes datasets.
